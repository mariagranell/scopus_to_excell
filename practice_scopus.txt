ABSTRACT: This study systematically reviewed available evidence regarding associations between polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and socio-emotional and behavioral functioning in children and adolescents. The search yielded 69 articles, which were grouped into nine categories: depression, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms, alcohol abuse, borderline personality disorder, conduct disorder symptoms or diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, early childhood attachment and behavior, pro-social skills, and resilience. Direct and/or gene x environment interactions were identified in over half of the studies. ASD and conduct disorder (including callous unemotional traits) were the diagnoses that were most studied and for which there was the strongest evidence of direct links with OXTR polymorphisms. In most studies identifying gene x environment interactions, the candidate OXTR polymorphism was rs53576. Results suggest that OXTR polymorphisms are associated with social, emotional or behavioural functioning in children and adolescents. The mixed findings do, however, highlight the need for further research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Sex differences in the reward value of familiar mates in prairie voles

ABSTRACT: The rewarding properties of social interactions facilitate relationship formation and maintenance. Prairie voles are one of the few laboratory species that form selective relationships, manifested as “partner preferences” for familiar partners versus strangers. While both sexes exhibit strong partner preferences, this similarity in outward behavior likely results from sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms. We recently demonstrated that in operant trials, females worked hardest for access to familiar conspecifics of either sex, while males worked equally hard for access to any female, indicating a sex difference in social motivation. As tests were performed with one social target at a time, males might have experienced a ceiling effect, and familiar females might be more relatively rewarding in a choice scenario. Here we performed an operant social choice task in which voles lever-pressed to gain temporary access to either the chamber containing their mate or one containing a novel opposite-sex vole. Females worked hardest to access their mate, while males pressed at similar rates for either female. Individual male behavior was heterogeneous, congruent with multiple mating strategies in the wild. Voles exhibited preferences for favorable over unfavorable environments in a non-social operant task, indicating that lack of social preference does not reflect lack of discrimination. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor genotype at the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism NT213739 was associated with oxytocin receptor density, and predicted individual variation in stranger-directed aggressive behavior. These findings suggest that convergent preference behavior in male and female voles results from sex-divergent pathways, particularly in the realm of social motivation. © 2022 The Authors.
